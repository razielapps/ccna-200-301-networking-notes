Of course. Let's proceed.

Topic 21: Cisco DNA Center

Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center is the central management dashboard for the Cisco SD-Access solution. Think of it as the operating system for your entire enterprise network. It is the practical implementation of SDN principles for campus and branch networks. DNA Center provides a single graphical interface to design, provision, apply policy, and assure the health of your network.

DNA Center is built on three key pillars:

1. Design:
In this phase, you define the logical and physical building blocks of your network. You input information about your network hierarchy:
- Sites: The physical locations (e.g., New York Headquarters, London Branch).
- Buildings: Structures within a site.
- Floors: Specific floors within a building.
You also create network profiles that define settings for different types of devices, such as the default IP address pool for Access Points.

2. Policy:
This is the most powerful aspect of DNA Center. Instead of configuring individual devices with ACLs and VLANs, you define intent-based policies.
- You create groups based on user identity or device type (e.g., "Finance_Users," "IP_Phones," "Guest_Devices").
- You then create policies that state what these groups are allowed to do. For example, you can create a policy that says "Finance_Users can access the Financial_Server," while "Guest_Users cannot access any internal resources."
DNA Center translates these simple business-level policies into complex network configurations and pushes them to the appropriate devices across the entire network.

3. Assurance:
DNA Center uses artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to continuously monitor the network. It does not just show if a device is up or down; it provides a health score for the entire network, individual devices, and even for specific client experiences.
- It can proactively identify issues, such as a specific model of Wi-Fi card having connectivity problems, and pinpoint the root cause.
- It provides a 360-degree view of any client, showing its connected device, AP, switch, and the policies applied to it, making troubleshooting incredibly fast.

The underlying technology that enables DNA Center is SD-Access. SD-Access provides network segmentation through a concept called Virtual Network (VN). A VN is a logical partition of the network, like a super-VLAN. Within a VN, you can have further segmentation using Scalable Groups (SGTs). This is a move away from traditional VLAN-based segmentation, which is difficult to manage at scale.

DNA Center uses a fabric architecture. Network devices play specific roles within this fabric:
- Control Plane Node: The "brain" of the fabric, it manages device authentication and policy distribution.
- Edge Nodes: These are the switches and APs where users and devices connect to the network.
- Border Nodes: These connect the SD-Access fabric to external networks, like the WAN or the internet.

Assignment 21: Exploring the Concept of Intent-Based Networking with DNA Center

Objective: To understand how a high-level business policy is automatically translated into network configuration.
1. This assignment is a conceptual walk-through since DNA Center is a physical/virtual appliance.
2. Imagine a company with two departments: Finance and Engineering. The requirement is that Finance users should not be able to access the Engineering servers, and vice-versa.
3. In a Traditional Network:
   - You would identify the switch ports where Finance users connect and assign them to a VLAN (e.g., VLAN 10).
   - You would assign the Engineering servers to another VLAN (e.g., VLAN 20).
   - You would then configure an ACL on the router or Layer 3 switch to block traffic between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20.
   - You would have to repeat this ACL configuration on every router that connects these segments.
4. In a DNA Center (SD-Access) Network:
   - Step 1 (Design): You would have already defined your network sites and device profiles in DNA Center.
   - Step 2 (Policy): You would take the following steps in the GUI:
     a. Create two Scalable Groups: `Finance_Users` and `Engineering_Servers`.
     b. Create an IP-based pool and assign the Engineering servers to the `Engineering_Servers` group. This is called Group-Based Policy (GBP) mapping.
     c. Create a policy in a simple matrix view:
        - Source: `Finance_Users` | Destination: `Engineering_Servers` | Action: `Deny`
        - (An implicit `Permit` would allow all other traffic).
   - Step 3 (Provision): DNA Center's controller would now translate this simple "Deny" policy. It would not create VLANs or standard ACLs on every switch. Instead, it would push the policy as a central rule to the Control Plane Node. Whenever a Finance user tries to communicate, the Edge Node they are connected to will query the Control Plane Node, which will enforce the "Deny" policy based on the SGTs.
5. The key difference is abstraction. The network administrator no longer needs to think about VLANs, ACL numbers, or which router to configure. They only think about the business groups and the policies that should apply between them. DNA Center handles the complex, device-specific CLI configurations in the background.

Glossary for Topic 21:
Cisco DNA Center: The central management platform for intent-based networks.
Intent-Based Networking: An approach where the administrator defines what the network should do, not how to do it.
SD-Access: Cisco's architecture for policy-based, automated campus networking.
Assurance: The use of AI/ML to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot the network.
Scalable Group (SGT): A tag used to enforce policies based on user/device identity, not IP address.
