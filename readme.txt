A comprehensive and beginner-friendly collection of notes, guides, and practical labs for the first module of the Cisco CCNA 200-301 certification: **Network Fundamentals**. This repository is designed to build a rock-solid understanding of networking concepts, moving beyond theory into hands-on configuration.

Struggling with the OSI model? Confused about subnetting? This repo breaks down complex topics into clear, detailed explanations with relatable analogies. It's perfect for aspiring network engineers, IT professionals, and anyone preparing for the CCNA exam who wants to truly *understand* the material, not just memorize it.

**What's Inside:**

*   **In-Depth Theoretical Notes:** Detailed, blog-style notes on every Network Fundamentals topic, including:
    *   Introduction to Networking & Types of Networks (LAN, WAN, WLAN)
    *   Network Topologies (Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid)
    *   Network Devices (Hubs, Switches, Routers, Firewalls, APs)
    *   The OSI Model & TCP/IP Model (Deep dive into encapsulation)
    *   IP Addressing (IPv4, Subnetting, CIDR, Public vs. Private IPs)
    *   Protocols and Ports (TCP vs. UDP, essential protocols like HTTP, SSH, DNS, DHCP)

*   **Hands-On Practical Labs:** Theory is nothing without practice! This repo includes:
    *   **Cisco Packet Tracer Labs:** Step-by-step guides for building and configuring network topologies.
    *   **Initial Lab Setup:** A complete guide to building your first network with routers, switches, and end devices.
